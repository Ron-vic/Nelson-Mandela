    <div class="ABOUT">
        <h1>Who is Nelson Mandela</h1>
        <p style="text-decoration-color: blue;">Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela ,born in Rolihlahla Mandela;(18 July 1918 - 5 December 2013) 
            was a South African anti-apartheid activist and politician who served as the first 
            president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.</p>
        <h1>Acheivements of Nelson Mandela</h1>
        <p>
            <li>Anti-Apartheid Activism: Mandela played a crucial role in the fight against apartheid,
                 a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa.
                  He was a member of the African National Congress (ANC) and participated in various 
                  campaigns and protests against apartheid policies.</li>
            <li>Imprisonment: Mandela's commitment to the anti-apartheid cause led to his arrest in 1962. 
                He spent 27 years in prison, during which he became a symbol of resistance against the 
                oppressive regime.</li>
            <li>Release from Prison: Mandela was released from prison on February 11, 1990, signaling the
                 end of apartheid. His release was a result of both national and international pressure on 
                 the South African government.</li>
            <li>Negotiations for Democracy: Mandela played a crucial role in the negotiations to dismantle 
                apartheid and establish a democratic, non-racial government in South Africa. These negotiations
                 ultimately led to the country's first democratic elections in 1994.</li>
             <li>First Black President of South Africa: In 1994, Nelson Mandela became the first black president
                 of South Africa, marking the end of apartheid rule. His presidency focused on reconciliation between 
                 the previously divided racial groups and building a more inclusive and democratic nation.</li> 
             <li>Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC): Mandela established the TRC to address the crimes and 
                human rights abuses committed during the apartheid era. The commission aimed to promote healing and 
                reconciliation by allowing individuals to confess their crimes in exchange for amnesty.</li>  
             <li>International Peacemaker: Mandela played a significant role in promoting peace and reconciliation not
                 only within South Africa but also on the international stage. He was involved in various peace initiatives
                  and advocated for human rights and equality globally.</li>  
             <li>Global Symbol of Freedom: Mandela became an international symbol of the struggle for freedom, justice, and 
                human rights. His legacy extends beyond South Africa, inspiring people worldwide to fight against oppression 
                and injustice.</li>     
             <li>Nobel Peace Prize: In 1993, Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with F.W. de Klerk, the former 
                president of South Africa, for their efforts in dismantling the apartheid system and establishing a democratic 
                government.</li>     
             <li>Retirement and Philanthropy: After his presidency, Mandela continued to be involved in various philanthropic 
                activities, focusing on issues such as HIV/AIDS awareness and peace-building efforts.</li>
